  abstract = {This paper presents linear models of the most common components in the value chain for {\textbackslash}hboxCO\_2 capture and storage. The optimal investment planning of new gas power plants traditionally includes the cost of fuel versus sales of electricity and heat from the plant. If a new power plant also causes additional investments in gas infrastructure, these should be included in the optimization. With the increasing focus on global {\textbackslash}hboxCO\_2 emissions, yet another aspect is introduced in the form of technology and infrastructure for capture, transport, and storage of {\textbackslash}hboxCO\_2. To be able to include all these aspects in the planning of new power plants, linear models for {\textbackslash}hboxCO\_2 capture and storage are formulated consistent with current models for gas, electricity, and heat infrastructures. This paper presents models for the following {\textbackslash}hboxCO\_2 infrastructure: source, combined cycle gas turbine producing electricity, heat and exhaust, capture plant, pipeline, liquefaction plant, storage, ship transport, injection pump, and demand/market.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates the technoeconomic impacts of direct and indirect electrification on the EU's net-zero emissions target by 2050. By linking the JRC-EU-TIMES long-term energy system model with PLEXOS hourly resolution power system model, this research offers a detailed analysis of the interactions between electricity, hydrogen and synthetic fuel demand, production technologies, and their effects on the power sector. It highlights the importance of high temporal resolution power system analysis to capture the synergistic effects of these components, often overlooked in isolated studies. Results indicate that direct electrification increases significantly and unimpacted by biomass, CCS, and nuclear energy assumptions. However indirect electrification in the form of hydrogen varies significantly, between 1400 and 2200 TWhH2 by 2050. Synthetic fuels are essential for sector coupling, making up 6--12\% of total energy consumption by 2050, with the power sector supplying most hydrogen and CO2 for their production. Varying levels of indirect electrification impact electrolysers, renewable energy, and firm capacities. Higher indirect electrification increases electrolyser capacity factors by 8\%, leading to more renewable energy curtailment but improves system reliability by reducing 11 TWh unserved energy and increasing flexibility options. These insights inform EU energy policies, stressing the need for a balanced approach to electrification, biomass use, and CCS to achieve a sustainable and reliable net-zero energy system by 2050. We also explore limitations and sensitivities.},

We present bounds on the value of the stochastic solution, that is, the potential benefit from solving the stochastic program over solving a deterministic program in which expected values have replaced random parameters. These bounds are calculated by solving smaller programs related to the stochastic recourse problem.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen represents a versatile energy carrier with net zero end use emissions. Power-to-Liquid (PtL) includes the combination of hydrogen with CO2 to produce liquid fuels and satisfy mostly transport demand. This study assesses the role of these pathways across scenarios that achieve 80--95\% CO2 reduction by 2050 (vs. 1990) using the JRC-EU-TIMES model. The gaps in the literature covered in this study include a broader spatial coverage (EU28+) and hydrogen use in all sectors (beyond transport). The large uncertainty in the possible evolution of the energy system has been tackled with an extensive sensitivity analysis. 15 parameters were varied to produce more than 50 scenarios. Results indicate that parameters with the largest influence are the CO2 target, the availability of CO2 underground storage and the biomass potential. Hydrogen demand increases from 7\,mtpa today to 20--120\,mtpa (2.4--14.4\,EJ/yr), mainly used for PtL (up to 70\,mtpa), transport (up to 40\,mtpa) and industry (25\,mtpa). Only when CO2 storage was not possible due to a political ban or social acceptance issues, was electrolysis the main hydrogen production route (90\% share) and CO2 use for PtL became attractive. Otherwise, hydrogen was produced through gas reforming with CO2 capture and the preferred CO2 sink was underground. Hydrogen and PtL contribute to energy security and independence allowing to reduce energy related import cost from 420\,bln{\texteuro}/yr today to 350 or 50\,bln{\texteuro}/yr for 95\% CO2 reduction with and without CO2 storage. Development of electrolyzers, fuel cells and fuel synthesis should continue to ensure these technologies are ready when needed. Results from this study should be complemented with studies with higher spatial and temporal resolution. Scenarios with global trading of hydrogen and potential import to the EU were not included.},

However, cross-border interconnector capacity is scarce and, more importantly, the progress of interconnector capacity expansion is too slow. As a result, the Commission has proposed several policy measures to accelerate interconnector investment. This paper provides an overview of the policy debate on interconnector expansion and studies two particular points. First, the effects of network regulation on interconnector investment and the policy proposals to improve the investment incentives, and more specifically, how to deal with risks. Second, we study the policies and effects of capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRMs) on the use of and need for cross-border interconnector capacity.},

To investigate this question, this study derives cost functions for the selected pipeline reassignment methods. By applying geospatial hydrogen supply chain modeling, the technical and economic potential of natural gas pipeline reassignment during a hydrogen market introduction is assessed. The results of this study show a technically viable potential of more than 80\% of the analyzed representative German pipeline network. By comparing the derived pipeline cost functions, it could be derived that pipeline reassignment can reduce the hydrogen transmission costs by more than 60\%. Finally, a countrywide analysis of pipeline availability constraints for the year 2030 shows a cost reduction of the transmission system by 30\% in comparison to a newly built hydrogen pipeline system.},

Planning hydrogen infrastructure requires a thorough understanding of the future role of hydrogen in the energy system. At the same time, there is still huge uncertainty about the future demand for hydrogen and its overall role. An energy systems analysis is conducted with high temporal and spatial as well as technological resolution under alternative demand scenarios. An energy system model is used to optimize the entire European energy system with hourly time resolution and high spatial consideration of renewable energy potentials. The hydrogen demand in the five scenarios ranges from about 700 TWh for mainly industrial uses to 2800 TWh in all sectors in the EU27 + UK by 2050. The results show that an integrated European hydrogen system is a robust element of the cost-optimal system design in all scenarios. This encompasses flexible electrolyzers at the most favorable wind and solar locations, long-distance hydrogen transport network, large-scale seasonal underground storage, and electricity generation for peak demand periods. Conclusions about the individual components are provided and high-resolution data on hydrogen demand are available for future research.},

  abstract = {Modeling the optimal design of the future European energy system involves large data volumes and many mathematical constraints, typically resulting in a significant computational burden. As a result, modelers often apply reductions to their model that can have a significant effect on the accuracy of their results. This study investigates methods for spatially clustering electricity system models at transmission level to overcome the computational constraints. Spatial reduction has a strong effect both on flows in the electricity transmission network and on the way wind and solar generators are aggregated. Clustering methods applied in the literature are typically oriented either towards preserving network flows or towards preserving the properties of renewables, but both are important for future energy systems. In this work we adapt clustering algorithms to accurately represent both networks and renewables. To this end we focus on hierarchical clustering, since it preserves the topology of the transmission system. We test improvements to the similarity metrics used in the clustering by evaluating the resulting regions with measures on renewable feed-in and electrical distance between nodes. Then, the models are optimised under a brownfield capacity expansion for the European electricity system for varying spatial resolutions and renewable penetration. Results are compared to each other and to existing clustering approaches in the literature and evaluated on the preciseness of siting renewable capacity and the estimation of power flows. We find that any of the considered methods perform better than the commonly used approach of clustering by country boundaries and that any of the hierarchical methods yield better estimates than the established method of clustering with k-means on the coordinates of the network with respect to the studied parameters.},

However, currently there is uncertainty about how much offshore wind energy can be integrated, whether offshore grids should be meshed and to what extent offshore hydrogen should play a role. To address these questions, we use the open-source energy system optimization model PyPSA-Eur to model a European carbon-neutral sector-coupled energy system in high spatial and temporal resolution. We let the model endogenously decide how much offshore wind is deployed and which infrastructure is used to integrate the offshore wind. We find that with point-to-point connections like we have today, 310 GW offshore wind can be integrated in the North Sea. However, if we allow meshed networks and hydrogen, we find that this can be raised to 420 GW with cost savings up to 15 bn{\texteuro}/a. Furthermore, we only observe significant amounts of up to 75 GW of floating wind turbines in the North Sea if we have offshore hydrogen production. Generally, the model opts for offshore wind integration through a mix of both electricity and hydrogen infrastructure. However, the bulk of the offshore energy is transported as hydrogen, which is twice as much as the amount transported as electricity. Moreover, we find that the offshore power network is mainly used for offshore wind integration, with only a small portion used for inter-country transmission.},

While the availability of open power plant databases increased in recent years, they often differ considerably from each other and their data quality has not been systematically compared to proprietary sources yet. Here, we introduce the python-based `powerplantmatching' (PPM), an open source toolset for cleaning, standardizing and combining multiple power plant databases. We apply it once only with open databases and once with an additional proprietary database in order to discuss and elaborate the issue of data quality, by analysing capacities, countries, fuel types, geographic coordinates and commissioning years for conventional power plants. We find that a derived dataset purely based on open data is not yet on a par with one in which a proprietary database has been added to the matching, even though the statistical values for capacity matched to a large degree with both datasets. When commissioning years are needed for modelling purposes in the final dataset, the proprietary database helps crucially to increase the quality of the derived dataset.},

Green hydrogen competes with carbon capture and storage, biomass and imports in reaching emissions reductions; earlier studies have demonstrated the great uncertainty in future cost-optimal development of green hydrogen. In spite of this, we show that Europe risks little by setting green hydrogen production targets at around 25 Mt by 2040. Employing an extensive scenario analysis combined with novel near-optimal techniques, we find that this target results in systems that are within 10\% of cost-optimal in most considered scenarios. Setting concrete targets is important in order to resolve significant uncertainty which hampers investments. Targeting green hydrogen reduces the dependence on carbon capture and storage and green fuel imports, making for a more robust European climate strategy.},

  abstract = {Import and export of fossil energy carriers are cornerstones of energy systems world-wide. If energy systems are to become climate neutral and sustainable, fossil carriers need to be substituted with carbon neutral alternatives or electrified if possible. We investigate synthetic chemical energy carriers, hydrogen, methane, methanol, ammonia and Fischer-Tropsch fuels, produced using electricity from Renewable Energy Source (RES) as fossil substitutes. RES potentials are obtained from GIS-analysis and hourly resolved time-series are derived using reanalysis weather data. We model the sourcing of feedstock chemicals, synthesis and transport along nine different Energy Supply Chains to Germany and compare import options for seven locations around the world against each other and with domestically sourced alternatives on the basis of their respective cost per unit of hydrogen and energy delivered. We find that for each type of chemical energy carrier, there is an import option with lower costs compared to domestic production in Germany. No single exporting country or energy carrier has a unique cost advantage, since for each energy carrier and country there are cost-competitive alternatives. This allows exporter and infrastructure decisions to be made based on other criteria than energy and cost. The lowest cost means for importing of energy and hydrogen are by hydrogen pipeline from Denmark, Spain and Western Asia and Northern Africa starting at 36 EUR/MWhLHV to 42 EUR/MWhLHV or 1.0 EUR/kgH2 to 1.3 EUR/kgH2 (in 2050, assuming 5\% p.a. capital cost). For complex energy carriers derived from hydrogen like methane, ammonia, methanol or Fischer-Tropsch fuels, imports from Argentina by ship to Germany are lower cost than closer exporters in the European Union or Western Asia and Northern Africa. For meeting hydrogen demand, direct hydrogen imports are more attractive than indirect routes using methane, methanol or ammonia imports and subsequent decomposition to hydrogen because of high capital investment costs and energetic losses of the indirect routes. We make our model and data available under open licenses for adaptation and reuse.},

Hydrogen networks serve regions with high energy demand, whereas emissions are transported away in carbon dioxide networks. For the synthesis of carbonaceous fuels, it is less clear which input should be transported: hydrogen to carbon point sources or carbon to low-cost hydrogen. Here we explore both networks' potential synergies and competition in cost-optimal carbon-neutral European energy systems. In direct comparison, a hydrogen network is more cost effective than a carbon network, as it serves to transport hydrogen to demand and to point sources of carbon for utilization. However, in hybrid scenarios where both networks are present, the carbon network effectively complements the hydrogen network, promoting carbon capture from distributed biomass and reducing reliance on direct air capture. The layouts of the hydrogen and carbon dioxide networks are robust if the climate target is tightened to be net negative.},

To reduce the scale of these, this paper discusses different methods for their aggregation into typical periods. Each aggregation method is applied to a different type of energy system model, making the methods fairly incomparable. To overcome this, the different aggregation methods are first extended so that they can be applied to all types of multidimensional time series and then compared by applying them to different energy system configurations and analyzing their impact on the cost optimal design. It was found that regardless of the method, time series aggregation allows for significantly reduced computational resources. Nevertheless, averaged values lead to underestimation of the real system cost in comparison to the use of representative periods from the original time series. The aggregation method itself e.g., k-means clustering plays a minor role. More significant is the system considered: Energy systems utilizing centralized resources require fewer typical periods for a feasible system design in comparison to systems with a higher share of renewable feed-in. Furthermore, for energy systems based on seasonal storage, currently existing models integration of typical periods is not suitable.},

We identify a potential lock-in effect of blue hydrogen in the medium term, highlighting the risk of long-term dependence on methane. In contrast, we show that a self-sufficient Europe relying on domestic green hydrogen by 2050 would increase yearly expenses by around 3\% and require 518 gigawatts of electrolysis capacity. This study emphasizes the importance of rapidly scaling up electrolysis capacity, building hydrogen networks and storage facilities, deploying renewable electricity generation, and ensuring coherent coordination across European nations.},

JRC-IDEES offers a consistent set of disaggregated energy-economy-environment data, compliant with the EUROSTAT energy balances, as well as widely acknowledged data on existing technologies. It provides a plausible decomposition of energy consumption, allocating it to specific processes and end-uses. Throughout all sectors it quantifies in a vintage-specific manner the characteristics of the energy (and non-energy related) equipment in use, along with the stock's average operation, identifies different drivers and provides insights on their role by sector, fully acknowledging structural differences across countries. An iterative consultation process aims at further improving the data reliability. By making JRC-IDEES publicly available and revise it periodically in order to address experts' and stakeholders' comments, it can become a cost-free common reference point for energy futures assessments, thereby also avoiding redundant work. JRC-IDEES is developed and maintained by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre},

In this paper, we develop a two-stage stochastic cost-minimization model of integrated European electricity and gas markets. The model identifies optimal investment decisions in power generation capacity and the scenario-specific optimal dispatch for assets in electricity and gas sectors. The paper presents a regret matrix that examines the performance of first-stage investment decisions under the later realization of considered scenarios. We find that the chance of high regrets strongly depends on the scenario the investment decision is based on. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of each uncertain parameter on the expected regret. We find that neglecting uncertainties with regard to electricity demand levels and CO2 prices in particular, result in a high regret. Furthermore, we quantify the value of perfect information.},

We apply the modeling-to-generate-alternatives (MGA) methodology to systematically explore the near-optimal feasible space of a completely renewable European electricity system model. While accounting for complex spatio-temporal patterns, we allow simultaneous capacity expansion of generation, storage and transmission infrastructure subject to linearized multi-period optimal power flow. Many similarly costly, but technologically diverse solutions exist. Already a cost deviation of 0.5\% offers a large range of possible investments.

Our investigation varies the allowed expansion of electricity and hydrogen grids in net-zero CO2 scenarios for a sector-coupled European energy system, capturing transmission bottlenecks, renewable supply and demand variability, and pipeline retrofitting and geological storage potentials. We find that a hydrogen network connecting regions with low-cost and abundant renewable potentials to demand centers, electrofuel production, and cavern storage sites reduces system costs by up to 26 bn{\texteuro}/a (3.4\%). Although expanding both networks together can achieve the largest cost reductions, by 9.9\%, the expansion of neither is essential for a net-zero system as long as higher costs can be accepted and flexibility options allow managing transmission bottlenecks.},

We show that a wide range of systems based on renewable energy are feasible, with no need to import energy from outside Europe. Model solutions reveal considerable flexibility in the choice and geographical distribution of new infrastructure across the continent. Balanced renewable energy supply can be achieved either with or without mechanisms such as biofuel use, curtailment, and expansion of the electricity network. Trade-offs emerge once specific preferences are imposed. Low biofuel use, for example, requires heat electrification and controlled vehicle charging.

  abstract = {In this study we describe a novel formulation of the so-called modelling to generate alternatives (MGA) methodology and use it to explore the near cost optimal solution space of the global energy-environment-economy model TIAM-UCL. Our implementation specifically aims to find maximally different global energy system transition pathways and assess the extent of their diversity in the near optimal region. From this we can determine the stability of the results implied by the least cost pathway which in turn allows us to both identify whether there are any consistent insights that emerge across MGA iterations while at the same time highlighting that energy systems that are very similar in cost can look very different. It is critical that the results of such an uncertainty analysis are communicated to policy makers to aid in robust decision making. To demonstrate the technique we apply it to two scenarios, a business as usual (BAU) case and a climate policy run. For the former we find significant variability in primary energy carrier consumption across the MGA iterations which then projects further into the energy system leading to, for example, large differences in the portfolio of fuels used in and emissions from the electricity sector. When imposing a global emissions constraint we find, in general, less variability than the BAU case. Consistent insights do emerge with oil use in transport being a robust finding across all MGA iterations for both scenarios and, in the mitigation case, the electricity sector is seen to reliably decarbonise before transport and industry as total system cost is permitted to increase. Finally, we compare our implementation of MGA to the so-called Hop-Skip-Jump formulation, which also seeks to obtain maximally different solutions, and find that, when applied in the same way, the former identifies more diverse transition pathways than the latter.},

We present reflections on estimates of future hydrogen demand, optimization of infrastructure for hydrogen production, transport and storage, development of viable business cases, and environmental impact evaluations using life cycle assessments. We highlight challenges and opportunities that are common across studies of the business cases for hydrogen in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Norway. The use of hydrogen in the industrial sector is an important driver and could incentivise large-scale hydrogen value chains. In the long-term hydrogen becomes important also for the transport sector. Hydrogen production from natural gas with capture and permanent storage of the produced CO2 (CCS) enables large-scale hydrogen production in the intermediate future and is complementary to hydrogen from renewable power. Furthermore, timely establishment of hydrogen and CO2 infrastructures serves as an anchor to support the deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies, such as direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and biohydrogen production with CCS. Significant public support is needed to ensure coordinated planning, governance, and the establishment of supportive regulatory frameworks which foster the growth of hydrogen markets.},

Several studies have investigated the most cost-efficient hydrogen supply chain structure, with a focus on hydrogen transportation. However, supply chain models based on hydrogen produced by electrolysis require additional seasonal hydrogen storage capacity to close the gap between fluctuation in renewable generation from surplus electricity and fuelling station demand. To address this issue, we developed a model that draws on and extends approaches in the literature with respect to long-term storage. Thus, we analyse Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) and show their potential impact on future hydrogen mobility. We demonstrate that LOHC-based pathways are highly promising especially for smaller-scale hydrogen demand and if storage in salt caverns remains uncompetitive, but emit more greenhouse gases (GHG) than other gaseous or hydrogen ones. Liquid hydrogen as a seasonal storage medium offers no advantage compared to LOHC or cavern storage since lower electricity prices for flexible operation cannot balance the investment costs of liquefaction plants. A well-to-wheel analysis indicates that all investigated pathways have less than 30\% GHG-emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel pathways within a European framework.},

Integrated energy models are used to assist decision-making for businesses and policymakers addressing challenges of energy transition and climate change. The analysis of complex energy systems requires large-scale models, which are based on extensive databases, intertemporal dynamics and a multitude of decision variables. Integrating such energy system models results in increased system complexity. This complexity poses a challenge for energy modellers to address multiple uncertainties that affect both markets. Stochastic optimisation approaches enable an adequate consideration of uncertainties in investment and operation planning; however, stochastic modelling of integrated large-scale energy systems further scales the level of complexity. In this paper, we combine integrated and stochastic optimisation problems and parametrise our model for European electricity and gas markets. We analyse and compare the impact of uncertain input parameters, such as gas and electricity demand, renewable energy capacities and fuel and CO2 prices, on the quality of the solution obtained in the integrated optimisation problem. Our results quantify the value of encoding uncertainty as a part of a model. While the methodological contribution should be of interest for energy modellers, our findings are relevant for industry experts and stakeholders with an empirical interest in the European energy system.},

We also report current costs for SCPC plants employing oxy-combustion for CO2 capture---an option that was still in the early stages of development at the time of the SRCCS. To compare current CCS cost estimates to those in the SRCCS, we adjust all costs to constant 2013 US dollars using cost indices for power plant capital costs, fuel costs and other O\&M costs. On this basis, we report changes in capital cost, levelized cost of electricity, and mitigation costs for each power plant system with and without CCS. We also discuss the outlook for future CCS costs.},

Here, we derive plausible ranges for both strategies based on EU climate neutrality scenarios using the REMIND model. We find that by 2050 direct electrification is the dominant strategy with an electricity share of 42\%--60\% in final energy, while indirect electrification is necessary in hard-to-electrify sectors and contributes a share of 9\%--26\%. Our analysis highlights that policy makers should respect the distinct sectoral roles of both strategies by fostering an end-use transformation towards direct electrification while prioritizing hydrogen and synthetic fuels for applications where they are indispensable.},

Both lead to climate neutrality in Europe in 2050 but the RP scenario differs by setting new reinforced targets for renewable technologies in Europe. Results show that hydrogen production would increase sharply in the coming decades, exceeding 30 million tons (Mt) by 2030 and more than 100~Mt by 2050 in both scenarios. Polyvalence of hydrogen in decarbonizing the European energy system for certain hard-to-abate energy uses in transport and industry is also observed. European hydrogen production relies on a diverse mix including both renewable and low-carbon technologies. It is complemented by hydrogen imports from neighboring regions, that represent between 10 and 15\% of total demand in 2050. Access to existing cross-border pipelines is a critical advantage compared to maritime transport. Notably, there are considerable cost reductions due to technology deployment for solar power and hydrogen production by electrolyzers.},

  abstract = {Bottom-up energy system models rely on cost optimization to produce energy scenarios that inform policy analyses, debates and decisions. This paper reviews the rationale for the use of cost optimization and questions whether cost-optimal scenarios are adequate proxies of the real-world energy transition. Evidence from ex-post modeling shows that cost optimization does not approximate the real-world UK electricity system transition in 1990--2014. The deviation in cumulative total system costs from the cost-optimal scenario in 1990--2014 is equal to 9--23\% under various technology, cost, demand, and discount rate assumptions. In fact, cost-optimal scenarios are shown to gloss over a large share of uncertainty that arises due to deviations from cost optimality. Exploration of large numbers of near-optimal scenarios under parametric uncertainty can give indication of the bounds or envelope of predictability of the real-world transition. Concrete suggestions are then made how to improve bottom-up energy system models to better deal with the vast uncertainty around the future energy transition. The paper closes with a reflective discussion on the tension between predictive and exploratory use of energy system models.},

This paper describes an extensive study on the acceptance of CCS by stakeholders in the Netherlands and explores one of the determining factors in the acceptance of CCS by the lay public, i.e. the way the Dutch press perceives and portrays CCS. The stakeholder analysis shows that there is a positive attitude towards CCS by industry, government, and environmental NGOs, provided that the conditions they pose on the deployment of CCS are met. The content analysis of Dutch news articles conveys that the media portrayal of CCS is---to a certain extent---a balanced reflection of the way CCS is perceived by the stakeholders. Both analyses show that the concerns about CCS have not overshadowed the main promise that CCS is part of the solution to climate change. However, the current negative aspects of CCS as raised by different stakeholders and the media will remain if no action is taken. Therefore, the conditions posed on the use of CCS, as well as the actions required to meet these conditions, could function as a proxy for the `societal voice', articulating the most important issues concerning the future acceptance of CCS technology.},

We present a stochastic two-stage optimisation model that captures the multistage nature of transmission planning under uncertainty and use it to evaluate interregional grid reinforcements in Great Britain (GB). In our model, a proactive transmission planner makes investment decisions in two time periods, each time followed by a market response. Uncertainty is represented by economic, technology, and regulatory scenarios, and first-stage investments must be made before it is known which scenario will occur. The model allows us to identify expected cost-minimising first-stage investments, as well as estimate the value of information, the cost of ignoring uncertainty, and the value of flexibility. Our results show that ignoring risk in planning transmission for renewables has quantifiable economic consequences, and that considering uncertainty can yield decisions that have lower expected costs than traditional deterministic planning methods. In the GB case, the value of information and cost of disregarding uncertainty in transmission planning were of the same order of magnitude (approximately {\pounds}100M, in present worth terms). Further, the best plan under a risk-neutral decision criterion can differ from the best under risk-aversion. Finally, a traditional sensitivity analysis-based robustness analysis also yields different results than the stochastic model, although the former's expected cost is not much higher.},

Green hydrogen competes with carbon capture and storage, biomass, and imports as well as direct electrification in reaching emissions reductions; earlier studies have demonstrated the great uncertainty in future cost-optimal development of green hydrogen. In spite of this, we show that Europe risks little by setting green hydrogen production targets at around 25 Mt by 2040. Employing an extensive scenario analysis combined with novel near-optimal techniques, we find that this target results in systems that are within 10\% of cost-optimal in all considered scenarios with current-day biomass availability and baseline transportation electrification. Setting concrete targets is important in order to resolve significant uncertainty that hampers investments. Targeting green hydrogen reduces the dependence on carbon capture and storage and green fuel imports, making for a more robust European climate strategy.},

The purpose of the article is to explain the modelling approach, to highlight strengths and challenges of the chosen approach, to create awareness about the possible applications of Balmorel as well as to inspire to new model developments and encourage new users to join the community. Some of the key strengths of the model are the flexible handling of the time and space dimensions and the combination of operation and investment optimisation. Its open source character enables diverse, worldwide applications for exploratory energy scenarios as well as policy analysis as the applications outlined demonstrate. The existing functionality and structural suitability for extensions make it a useful tool for assessing challenges of the ongoing energy transitions. Numerous model extensions have been developed as different challenges to the energy transition have arisen. One of these includes the option of running the model with unit commitment. To meet new challenges, further development is needed and consequently the article outlines suggestions for future development, such as including transport of local biomass as part of the optimisation and speeding up the model.},

Abstract The European Union aims to achieve climate-neutrality by 2050, with interim 2030 targets including 55\% greenhouse gas emissions reduction compared to 1990 levels, 10 Mt p.a. of a domestic green H2 production, and 50 Mt p.a. of domestic CO2 injection capacity. To support these targets, Projects of Common and Mutual Interest (PCI-PMI) --- large infrastructure projects for electricity, hydrogen and CO2 transport, and storage --- have been identified by the European Commission. This study focuses on PCI-PMI projects related to hydrogen and carbon value chains, assessing their long-term system value and the impact of pipeline delays and shifting policy targets using the sector-coupled energy system model PyPSA-Eur. Our study shows that PCI-PMI projects enable a more cost-effective transition to a net-zero energy system compared to scenarios without any pipeline expansion. Hydrogen pipelines help distribute affordable green hydrogen from renewable-rich regions in the north and southwest to high-demand areas in central Europe, while CO2 pipelines link major industrial emitters with offshore storage sites. Although these projects are not essential in 2030, they begin to significantly reduce annual system costs --- by more than {\texteuro}26 billion --- from 2040 onward. Delaying implementation beyond 2040 could increase system costs by up to {\texteuro}24.2 billion per year, depending on the extent of additional infrastructure development. Moreover, our results show that PCI-PMI projects reduce the need for excess wind and solar capacity and lower reliance on individual CO2 removal technologies, such as Direct Air Capture, by 13 to 136 Mt annually, depending on the build-out scenario.

However, there is a concern that the uncertainties inherent in the model structures and input parameters are at best underplayed and at worst ignored. Compared to other types of energy models, ESOMs tend to use scenarios to handle uncertainties or treat them as a marginal issue. Without adequately addressing uncertainties, the model insights may be limited, lack robustness, and may mislead decision makers. This paper provides an in-depth review of systematic techniques that address uncertainties for ESOMs. We have identified four prevailing uncertainty approaches that have been applied to ESOM type models: Monte Carlo analysis, stochastic programming, robust optimization, and modelling to generate alternatives. For each method, we review the principles, techniques, and how they are utilized to improve the robustness of the model results to provide extra policy insights. In the end, we provide a critical appraisal on the use of these methods.},

They have either left out important sectors of hydrogen demand, ignored the temporal variability in the system or neglected the dynamics of learning effects. We address these limitations and consider learning-by-doing for the full green hydrogen production chain with different climate targets in a detailed European sector-coupled model. Here, we show that in the next 10 years a faster scale-up of electrolysis and renewable capacities than envisaged by the EU in the REPowerEU Plan can be cost-optimal to reach the strictest +1.5oC target. This reduces the costs for hydrogen production to 1.26 {\texteuro}/kg by 2050. Hydrogen production switches from grey to green hydrogen, omitting the option of blue hydrogen. If electrolysis costs are modelled without dynamic learning-by-doing, then the electrolysis scale-up is significantly delayed, while total system costs are overestimated by up to 13\% and the levelised cost of hydrogen is overestimated by 67\%.},

Transport is the only sector with rising emissions, with an increase of 24\% compared to 1990. The EU initially aimed to ban new CO2-emitting cars by 2030 but has since delayed this target to 2035, underscoring the ongoing challenges in the push for rapid decarbonisation. The pace of decarbonisation in this sector will either ease or intensify the pressure on other sectors to stay within the EU's carbon budget. This paper explores the effects of speeding up or slowing down the transition in road transport. We reveal that a slower decarbonisation path not only drives up system costs by 126 billion {\texteuro}/a (6\%) but also demands more than a doubling of the CO2 price from 137 to 290 {\texteuro}/t in 2030 to trigger decarbonisation in other sectors. On the flip side, accelerating the shift to cleaner transport proves to be the most cost-effective strategy, giving room for more gradual changes in the heating and industrial sectors, while reducing the reliance on carbon removal in later years. Earlier mandates than currently envisaged by the EU can avoid stranded assets and save up to 43 billion {\texteuro}/a compared to current policies.},
